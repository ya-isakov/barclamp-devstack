  # Requires allows you to declare that this barclamp relies on
  # another barclamp to provide some of its functionality.
  # All barclamps implicitly rely on the crowbar barclamp.
  #requires:
  #  - another-barclamp # rely on a single other barclamp
  #  - @barclamp-group  # rely on another group of barclamps.
  # Member allows you to declare that this barclamp is a member
  # of a group of related barclamp.  A barclamp can be a member of 
  # muliple groups, and a group name can be used instead of a barclamp
  # in a requires: clause by prefixing it with an @ sign. 
  member:
    - openstack
  # Os_support allows you to declare that this barclamp only supports
  # specific operating systems.  If you don't have an os_support
  # section, Crowbar will assume the barclamp works on all the operating
  # systems it supports.

# debs, gems, rpms and extra_files allow you declare the OS packages,
# gems, and raw files that this barclamp needs.

# debs allows you to declare extra repositories to pull packages from
# and delare that packages that you need for systems that use Debian-style
# packaging.  
debs:
  # pkgs is a list of extra packages that the build system will try to pull
  # and cache on the crowbar iso image.  You only have to list top-level 
  # packages here -- if apt-get install gets all the dependencies, you do not
  # need to list them here.
  pkgs:
    # put your packages here
    - git

# extra_files downloads and saves a file to be slipstreamed on to the 
# crowbar .iso in the extra/files directory (or a subdirectory thereof).
# The build system will try to extract the .rpm files from 
# anything that looks like an Oracle java rpm.bin and treat the extracted
# .rpm files as if they were provided by raw_pkgs. 
extra_files:
  # will place file into extra/files
